Are you looking to start investing and build your retirement fund? Do you want to start a FIRE (gain Financial Independence and Retire Early)? Let us assume that you wish to invest in a share or an Exchange Traded Fund (ETF). We shall henceforth refer to these shares and ETFs collectively as instruments.\nTikerly aims to help you make an informed decision when you choose to buy/sell financial instruments. It identifies and flags positive and negative momentum in instruments’ prices. Any information on the website should only be used as a guide to your investment decision. You must conduct your own research before acting\nHow Does Tikerly Help Tikerly analyses the prices of hundreds of instruments traded in the US financial markets. It identifies the instruments with positive and negative momentum observed in their prices. It does so by reading the market sentiment inherent in prices, guided by a technique called Stage Analysis created by the legendary trader, Stan Weinstein.\nEvery price movement is assumed to be result of the struggle between the Bulls (those that believe the price will go up) and the Bears (those that believe that the price will go down).\nEach instrument is classified under one of 4 stages\nStage 1: The Basing Area Instruments in Stage 1 lose the negative momentum in their prices. Prices flatten out gradually and could potentially increase in the near future.. These instruments are a “Watch to Buy”. During this stage, the Bears lose momentum and the Bulls slowly emerge in strength\nStage 2: Advancing Phase Instruments in Stage 2 show a positive upward movement in their prices. In this stage the instrument is a “Buy to Hold”. The Bulls gain and the Bears lose their respective numbers.\nStage 3: The Top Area Instruments in Stage 3 lose upward momentum in their prices, which flatten after a period of upward movement. At this stage, the instruments become a “Hold to Sell”. The Bulls lose their numbers while the Bears slowly start gaining numbers.\nStage 4: The Declining Phase Instruments in Stage 4 have their prices decline. At this stage, the instruments become a “Sell or Short”. The Bears have taken over at this stage and the Bulls have retreated in numbers.\nGolden Rules of Stage Analysis Never Buy without checking the charts first Never invest in an instrument in Stage 4 or in Stage 3 Always have a Trailing Stop-Loss for every instrument you have bought Always Buy an instrument only if it is in Stage 2 or, selectively, in Stage 1 Always Buy an instrument that is doing well relative to the underlying market Don’t buy during a bear market If you follow the above rules consistently, you will be right a majority of the time. You will let your profit run, whilst cutting your losses in a timely manner. You will build your wealth gradually and gain financial freedom\nAll investment strategies and investments involve risk of loss.
